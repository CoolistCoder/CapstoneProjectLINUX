This is a log of all minor events that have occured within the Capstone Project so far.  As such,
this log is not designed for the end customer, but stands as a milestone within milestones to show
the dedication it took to go about a project of this scope.

1/28/20
	Steven and I focused our attention on the process of making sure that we understood how Git worked.
	While I initially thought it would be uneventful, it proved to be a tad time consuming as I had
	forgot to fetch and pull properly, leading to merge errors.  Once we had figured those out, we both
	managed to figure it all out and come up with a system in order to prevent merge issues.
	
1/31/20
	I managed to show Steven how a few of the quirkier aspects of Git worked and how to link the libraries
	we need to make this possible.  He's picking things up extremely fast and now it looks as though we're
	about to really get started.  I am planning on joining back up with him on Monday once we've touched
	bases with Professor Moreno.  Right now, it all looks as though things are going to go smoothly now that
	we've managed to get everything up to speed.

2/3/20
	Steven and I met with the professor to submit our first progress report.  So far, we are both up to speed
	and are able to begin working on our project.  We have plans to start and finish the window component before
	Friday the 14th.  I have plans on how to implement this, but we should be able to get this almost totally
	complete by then.  I am able to implement a whole working window for an engine in about 2 hours, so we
	should be totally prepared come Friday.
	
2/6/20
	Managed to apply almost all of the OpenGL initialization calls needed to make the engine work.  This was a
	big task that required a lot of reworking old conceptions I had about OpenGL, but if all goes well then
	the engine is prepped to draw 2D.  All I need to do is add additional features like input among other things
	so that the engine can really get going.  
	
2/10/20
	Steven was feeling under the weather for the past few days, so we decided it'd be better if he do what he can
	now and then recover as soon as possible.  On my end, it seems as though everything is going well and I can
	probably finish up before Friday, with the next week or so dedicated to bugfixes.  I want to make sure that 
	any possible issues are taken care of as soon as possible.
	
2/19/20
	I had contracted my own illness and had been under the weather for a good week, long enough for my illness to
	affect my work.  However, I have managed to implement as much as I needed to and maybe a little more.  I am
	currently preparing for the first milestone, and Steven is catching up with my work very well.  We may be
	able to present a small report of our research.
	
2/23/20
	I am ready to proceed with my presentation for the first presentation. After extensive bugtesting and 
	variable adjustment, I have come up with a build I am satisfied with.  My partner should be catching up
	to my work shortly, and I will be touching bases with him tonight.  Hoping for the best.
	
3/3/20
	While I believe our meeting went well, it is imperative we do not slack on this milestone.  This is where
	the real meat of the project is.  I have met with Steven to explain this concept of scenes and entities, and
	I want to have it all done by this milestone if possible.  While I know my ambition may be a little excessive,
	I believe it is possible to get it all completed by this point.
	
3/7/20
	In the middle of working on the entities and improving some of their aspects like coupling and decoupling, 
	I had a vivid idea for how I should handle errors.  I want to create a simple object that contains the
	error information should the developer need it.  So if the engine crashes there is at least a simple
	way to check for errors.
